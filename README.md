# Espanso Emojis
This is a package created for [espanso](https://espanso.org/) called `actually-all-emojis` that provides up-to-date emoji triggers.

The method behind the package is very simple. Emoji unicode values and names are fetched from [Unicode.org](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). They're then formatted and processed in Python and exported as a yml file.

There are two versions of the package:
- Default (underscores) - this formats the espanso triggers with underscores between words (e.g. `:kissing_face:`)
- Spaces - this formats the espanso triggers with spaces between words (e.g. `:kissing face:`)
